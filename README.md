Dit is een voorbeeld van een AI-Agent dashboard gemaakt in samenwerking met ai·êßify

Goals

- Keep your prompts and api keys hidden from end-user
- Build agents that can use multiple tools easily and serve them as new base-models
- Unrestricted access to any basemodel from any provider, including self-hosted
- Create an offering for companies that allows their team shared access to useful work-related agents, while keeping an eye on privacy, cost, and compliance.

TODO:

- add ratelimit functionality so this can be added as a free lead magnet
- remove custom content-host part from HTML, and replace that with an optional tool that does roughly the same
- create instructions for easily adding agents and tools
